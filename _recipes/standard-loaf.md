## info

{:.info}
* About 60 minutes + proofing
* 1kg loaf  

## ingredients

{:.ingredients}
* 400g white flour
* 50g wholemeal flour
* 150g rye flour
* 10g salt
* 400ml water

## steps  

{:.steps}
1. Feed starter the day before so it's happy (60g of rye/white flour and 60g water)
2. Mix the 120g starter with remaining flour and water (so you should get 1kg of dough)
3. Add the salt and knead by hand or machine for 10 minutes
4. Let rise until double in size, say 4-6 hours. During the first 90 minutes fold the dough onto itself 3-4 times, every 30 minutes.
5. Put dough onto a flowered surface, shape it by rolling it up and tucking the sides under. Roll it back and forth a few times to close the seam.
6. Let rise for 45-75 minutes
7. Preheat oven to 220C and put some water on the oven floor or a tray on the lowest setting to create humidity
8. When hot, bake bread for 40 minutes.
